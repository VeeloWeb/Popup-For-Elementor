== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Elementor Pro? =  
No. Popup for Elementor works perfectly with **Elementor Free**.

= How do I make a popup appear when users click a button or link? =  
Use the **Click Trigger** (added in version 1.5.8).  
You can set a CSS selector or Elementor element to open the popup.

= Can I control when the popup appears? =  
Yes — you can trigger it **on load**, **after a delay**, **on click**, or **on exit intent**.

= Does Exit Intent work on mobile? =  
Yes — since **1.6.2**, Exit Intent includes a **mobile fallback** that triggers after a minimum time on page and scroll depth.

= Can I show the popup only once? =  
Yes. Enable the **Show only once** option to use a cookie that prevents the popup from appearing again.  
Since **1.6.2**, the cookie is set **when the user closes the popup** (X, overlay, or Escape).

= Can I use Elementor templates inside the popup? =  
Absolutely. Load any Elementor template or section inside the popup container.
